 Meet FunWrite, a font family for its exceptional ability to engage
 children aged 5-7. The fonts' resemblance to handwritten text,
 complete with varied styles and imperfections, resonates with young
 learners and fosters a sense of creativity and ownership. The
 FunWrite font family is particularly well-suited for educational
 materials, creative writing, and artistic projects, as it encourages
 self-expression and imagination. Its unique characteristics make it
 an ideal tool for developing fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination,
 and literacy skills in early childhood development
